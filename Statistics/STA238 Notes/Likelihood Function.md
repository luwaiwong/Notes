The **Likelihood** [Function](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Function.md), which takes in a dataset, and returns the probability of observing the data, based on information we have.

For a dataset $x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}$,  we create a likelihood function which describes the probability of us attaining this dataset, as a function of the parameter $\theta$, which we notate $L(\theta)$ :  
$$L(\theta)=P(X_{1}=x_{1},...,X_{n}=x_{n})=p_{\theta}(x_{1})...p_{\theta}(x_{n})$$

The **Likelihood Function** is a function which is important in creating the [Maximum Likelihood Estimator](Maximum%20Likelihood%20Estimator.md)
