# W4. Evaluating estimators

### Learning outcomes

- Apply the method of moments to estimate the mean and variance of a statistical model using appropriate sample statistics
- Compare the efficiencies of estimators for a parameter based on their mean squared errors.
- Derive the mean squared error of an estimator with a known sampling distribution.
- Compute the lower bound of the variance of an estimator using the Cram√©r-Rao inequality.
