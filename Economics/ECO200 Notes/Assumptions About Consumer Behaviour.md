All decisions about what to buy share 4 properties
1. **Completeness and Rankability**  
	Consumers make comparisons across all possible sets of goods. [Consumption Bundle](Consumption%20Bundle.md)s are any set of goods or services a consumer considers purchasing. Just means that consumers can determine if a bundle of goods are better than another
2. **For most goods, more is better than less (or at least more is no worse than less)**
3. **Transitivity**  
	For any three bundles of goods (A, B and C), if a consumer prefers A to B, and prefers B to C, then she prefers A to C.
4. **Taste for Variety, The more a consumer has of a particular good, the less they are willing to give up of something else to get even more of a good**  
	Basically, consumers like variety. If a consumer already has a lot of something, they are more likely to want something else.
