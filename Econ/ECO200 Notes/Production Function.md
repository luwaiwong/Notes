The **Production [Function](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Function.md)** describes how much output can be made form different combinations of inputs.

---
# Notation
Production functions describe the **output** (**$Q$**) given a function of two inputs, **capital** (**$K$**) and **Labour** (**$L$**): $$Q=f(K,L)$$
In the [Short Run](Short%20Run.md), when capital is fixed, it is denoted as $$\overline{K}$$
# Long Run VS. Short Run
## Long Run
In the long run, firms can adjust all their inputs. **Capital** and **Labour** are both free to be adjusted
This means, for a typical production function $Q=f(K,L)$, when capital is fixed, the **production function** is a **two variable** [Function](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Function.md)

## Short Run
In the short run, firms can only adjust their **Labour**, and **Capital** is essentially fixed. 
This means, for a typical production function $Q=f(K,L)$, when capital is fixed, the **production function** is essentially a one variable [Function](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Function.md).

# Marginal Product
The [Marginal Product](Marginal%20Product.md) is the *additional output a firm can produce* by using an *additional unit of an input (holding use of other input constant)*, or essentially the [Partial Derivative](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Partial%20Derivative.md) of the production function
