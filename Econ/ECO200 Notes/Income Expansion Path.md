A curve that connects a consumer's [optimal bundles](Utility%20Optimization.md) at each income levels in a [Utility Function](Utility%20Function.md)

---
# Behaviour
When both goods are [Normal Good](Normal%20Good.md)s, the **income Expansion Path** will be **positively sloped**, because consumption of both goods rises when income does

If the slope of the **income expansion path** is **negative**, then the quantity consumed of one of the goods falls with income while the other rises. The **The one whose quantity falls is an [Inferior Good](Inferior%20Good.md)** 

# Example of an Income Expansion Path

In this example, bus rides start out as a [Normal Good](Normal%20Good.md) but become an [Inferior Good](Inferior%20Good.md) as income rises.
Bottled water in this example is **never inferior**, because the path never curves back to the left
