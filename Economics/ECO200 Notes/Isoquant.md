An **Isoquant** plots the curve of all the possible combinations of inputs which [produce](Production%20Function.md) a given amount of output.

# Properties
Similar to [Indifference Curves](Indifference%20Curve.md), **isoquants**
- Cannot cross
- Points further from the origin correspond to higher output levels
- Isoquants are convex to the origin

# Curvature 
The **curvature** of an isoquant shows how easily firms can substitute one input for another in production

Perfect substitutes make result in perfectly straight isoquant curves, while perfect complements make "L" shaped right angles

# Marginal Rate 
The **slope** of the isoquant represents the *tradeoff in the productive abilitys of capital and labour*.

The **Negative of the Slope of the Isoquant** is called the [Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution](Marginal%20Rate%20of%20Technical%20Substitution.md)

# Etymology
Greek prefix *iso-* means "the same"  
*quant* is a shortened version of "quantity"

Together, *isoquant* means "the same quantity"
