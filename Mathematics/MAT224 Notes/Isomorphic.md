Two [Vector Spaces](Vector%20Space.md) are $V$ and $W$ are **Isomorphic**, if there exists a [Linear Transformation](../MAT223%20Notes/Linear%20Transformation.md) $T:V\rightarrow W$ that is an [Isomorphism](Isomorphism.md)
- If two vector spaces have the same [Dimension](../MAT223%20Notes/Dimension.md), they are isomorphic

>Isomorphisms of vector spaces are a way to describe the way some vector spaces are really "the same", even though the elements may be written in different ways
