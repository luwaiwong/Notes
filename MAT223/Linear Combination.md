A **Linear Combination** of a [Set](Set.md) of [Vector](Vector.md)s $\vec{v}_{1},\ ... \ \vec{v}_{n} \in V$  is a vector
$$\vec{w} \ = \ a_1\vec{v}_{2} \ + \ ... \ + a_{n}\vec{v}_n$$
with the [Scalar](Scalar.md)s $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ ... \ a_{n}$ being any number and called the *coefficients* of the **linear combination**

A linear combination is essentially every single possible vector that can be created by adding combinations of a set of vectors.

**Any** vector can be obtained with linear combinations of other vectors

	Every vector can be obtained with linear combinations of only two vectors
