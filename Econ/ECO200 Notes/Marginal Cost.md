**Marginal Cost** is a firm's cost of producing one more unit of output

---
# Definition
$$MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$$  
	Where $\Delta TC$ is the *change in [Total Cost](Total%20Cost.md), and $\Delta Q$ is a *1-unit change in output*.  
	Or, the [Derivative](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Derivative.md) of [Total Cost](Total%20Cost.md)

Practically,  
$$MC = \frac{\Delta VC}{\Delta Q}$$  
	Where $\Delta VC$ is the *change in [Variable Cost](Variable%20Cost.md), and $\Delta Q$ is a *1-unit change in output*.  
	Or, the [Derivative](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Derivative.md) of [Total Cost](Total%20Cost.md)  
This is because [Fixed Cost](Fixed%20Cost.md)s are constant

## Properties
- In the graphical example, marginal costs decrease, and then increase  
	Reasons
	- Marginal cost may initially fall at low quantities because of complications in producing the first few units, or [Economies of Scale](Economies%20of%20Scale.md)
	- As output increases, there may be capacity constraints, inputs become more expensive, harder to coordinate operations
# Average Costs
If the marginal cost for a good is *less* than the [Average Cost](Average%20Cost.md), producing an extra unit of the good will result in [Average Cost](Average%20Cost.md) decreasing
