The **Kernel** is all elements in a [Linear Transformation](../../MAT223/Linear%20Transformations.md) which map to 0

---
# Definition

Let $T: V \rightarrow W$ be a [Linear Transformation](../../MAT223/Linear%20Transformations.md)

The [Kernel](.md) of $T$ is the subset of $V$ consisting of all vectors $v\in V$ such that $T(v)=0$ 

# Properties
- The **Kernel** is a [Subspace](../../MAT223/Subspace.md) of $V$

# Theorems
The Dimension Theorem
	if $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space and $T:V\rightarrow W$ is a linear transformation, then:
		$dim(Ker(T))+dim(Im(T))=dim(V)$
