The **Marginal Product** is the *additional output a firm can produce* by using an *additional unit of an input (holding use of other input constant)*

---
# Formal Definition
The **Marginal Product of Labour** ($MP_{L}$) would be the *change in quantity 
($\Delta Q$)* resulting form a 1-unit *change in labour inputs ($\Delta L$)*:$$MP_{L}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$$
We can calculate this value as:
$$ MP_{L}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}=\frac{f(K,L+\Delta L)-f(K,L)}{\Delta L}$$

The **Marginal Product** is can be calculated as the [Partial Derivative](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Partial%20Derivative.md) of the [Production Function](Production%20Function.md)
