1. drawing balls, chance of getting red red black b.) write parameters of this problem c.) independent?

2. joint question where you have to solve for c

b.) solve for y<=k given P(x<=number (i forgot) and y<=k) = 2/3

3. conditional probability find y <= number given x = 0.5

4. poisson distribution, average 2, probability of more than 1 occurrence in duration

b.) if you did 5 trials, what is the probability that more than 2 trials would have more than 1 occurrence 5.) there are 5 urns, 2 of the urns have 2 white 10 black, 2 of the urns have some other combination of white and black totalling 12, and 1 of the urns have some other combo. Given that you randomly choose an urn and draw 3 balls and 2 of those balls are the same color, what is the probability that it's from a 2 white 10 black urn?
