# Formal Definition
Formally:  
$$ E_i^{D}=\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta I}=\frac{\Delta Q/Q}{\Delta I/I}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta I}\frac{I}{Q}$$Where $Q$ is the **quantity** of the good consumed, and $I$ is **income**

# Income Effect
The **sign** of the **income elasticity** is the same as the sign of the [Income Effect](Income%20Effect.md)  
The **first ratio** in the income elasticity definition is the [Income Effect](Income%20Effect.md), or $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta I}$

[Normal Good](Normal%20Good.md)s have a **positive** income elasticity  
[Inferior Good](Inferior%20Good.md)s have a **negative** income elasticity
