A technique for transforming a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained problem by combining the objective and the constraint into one equation.

$\lambda$ is a variable that multiplies the constraint

---
# Usage
Suppose you have an objective function being $f(x,y)$ and a constraint is $g(x,y)=0$. 

We can rewrite the two functions as the **Lagrangian Equation**$$L(x,y,\lambda)=f(x,y)+\lambda(g(x,y))$$We can then use the partial derivatives of this equation to solve for the system of equations
