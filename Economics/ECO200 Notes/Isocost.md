The **Isocost** plots the curve of all the possible combination of inputs which result in a level of cost

It represents the amount of [Capital](Capital.md) and [Labour](Labour.md) the firm can purchase for a given total expenditure

---
# Mathematical Definition
The **Isocost** line corresponding to a total expenditure level of *C* is: $$C=RK+WL$$  
C: The total expenditure level  
R: The price(*rental rate*) per unit of **capital**  
W: The price(*wage*) per unit of **labour**  
K: Number of units of **capital**  
L: Number of units of **labour**

# Properties
- Lines for higher total expenditure levels are *further from the origin*
- Lines are parallel, *all have the same slope, regardless of total cost level*
- When labour becomes more expensive, line becomes *steeper*

- When capital becomes more expensive, line becomes *flatter*
