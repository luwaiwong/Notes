The [Dimension](Dimension.md) of the [Range](Range.md) of a linear transformation

---

# Formal Definition & Notation
For a linear transformation $T:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, the **rank** of $T$, denoted $rank(T)$ is the [Dimension](Dimension.md) of the [Range](Range.md) of $T$

# Why?
The rank of a linear transformation is used for measure its *complexity* or *compressibility*
