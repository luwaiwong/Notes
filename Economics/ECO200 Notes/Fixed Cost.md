# Properties
- They must be paid even if the firm is producing nothing
- Can only be avoided if a firm completely shuts down
- [Average Fixed Cost](Average%20Fixed%20Cost.md) goes down as quantity goes up
# Examples
- cost of rent
- Costs of buying and maintaining equipment
- Labour  
	 Fixed costs are typically thought of as relating to capital inputs, like equipment and rent, but labour can be considered fixed costs too  
	 You can't really just fire all your employees
