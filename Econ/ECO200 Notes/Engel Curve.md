# Properties
The **Y-Axis** of an **Engel curve** shows  **level of income**  
The **X-Axis** of an **Engel curve** shows **quantity consumed**

If an **Engel Curve** has a:
- Positive Slope, the good is a [Normal Good](Normal%20Good.md) at that income
- Negative Slope, the good is an [Inferior Good](Inferior%20Good.md) at that income
