A **Basis** for a [Subspace](Subspace.md) $V$ is a **Linearly Independent**([Linear Independence](Linear%20Independence.md)) [Set](Set.md) of [Vector](Vector.md)s, $B$, so that $spanB=V$. 
Basically, a basis is a subspace defined in its most basic form.

## Properties
1. Bases are not unique. Every subspace (except for the [Trivial Subspace](Trivial%20Subspace.md)) has multiple bases
2. Every vector in the base of a subspace can be written as a *unique* [Linear Combination](Linear%20Combination.md) of vectors in that basis ([Dimension](Dimension.md))
3. Any 2 bases for the same subspace have the same number of elements ^7d8441

The [Standard Basis](Standard%20Basis.md) for $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set $\{\vec{e}_{1},...,\vec{e}_n\}$ where $$\vec{e}_1=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\\\vdots\end{bmatrix} \vec{e}_2=\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\0\\\vdots\end{bmatrix}\vec{e}_3=\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\\\vdots\end{bmatrix}$$That is, $\vec{e}_i$ is the vector with a 1 in its ith coordinate and zeros elsewhere. 
The **Standard basis** can describe all the elements in $R^n$
