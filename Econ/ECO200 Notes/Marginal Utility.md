**Marginal Utility** is the [Utility](Utility.md) a [consumer](consumer) receives from a 1-unit increase in consumption.

---
# Properties
Each good in a [Utility Function](Utility%20Function.md) has its own **marginal utility**
# Formal Definition & Notation
Given the [Utility Function](Utility%20Function.md) of a consumer which consumes two goods, $J$ and $K$,  
The **Marginal Utility** of $J$ is:  
$$MU_J=\frac{\Delta U(J,K)}{\Delta{J}}$$Or, the [Derivative](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Derivative.md) of the **utility function** over the change in $J$

Alternatively, The **Marginal Utility** of a good $J$ is: $$MU_{J}=U_{J}(J,K)$$  
Or, the [Partial Derivative](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Partial%20Derivative.md) of the **utility function** with respect to $J$
