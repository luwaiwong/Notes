The **Marginal Rate of Substitution** represents the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade off or substitute exactly 1 unity of good X (good on horizontal axis) for more of good Y (the good on the vertical axis) and feel equally well off, with [Utility](Utility.md) held constant 

---
# Formal Definition
Given a [Indifference Curve](Indifference%20Curve.md)  
$$MRS_{XY}=-\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}$$  
Or, the value of the slope/[Derivative](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Derivative.md) of the [Indifference Curve](Indifference%20Curve.md) at a point  
With a [Utility Function](Utility%20Function.md):$$\begin{aligned} \text{Slope of indifference curve(Marginal Rate of Sub)} &= \text{Slope of budget}\\-MRS_{XY}&=-\frac{MU_X}{MU_Y}\\\frac{MU_X}{MU_Y}&=\frac{P_X}{P_Y}\end{aligned}$$The marginal rate for a utility function with two variables is the [Partial Derivative](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Partial%20Derivative.md) of the utility function with respect to one variable, over the **partial derivative** of the of the utility function with respect to the other variable



# Marginal Utility Per Dollar Spent
We can also rewrite this optimization equation in terms of the consumer's **marginal utility per dollar spent**:$$\frac{MU_X}{MU_Y}=\frac{P_X}{P_{Y}}\implies \frac{MU_X}{P_X}=\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$$
