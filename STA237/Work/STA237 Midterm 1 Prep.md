Chapter 1 has nothing important

### Notes
Probability is science of uncertainty
Help up make predictions, make better decisions

[Outcomes](../Notes/Outcomes.md), [Event](../Notes/Event.md)s, [Probability](../Notes/Probability.md) and that exists
[Sample Space](../Notes/Sample%20Space.md), is collection of all possible outcomes of random experiment
[Set](../../MAT223/Set.md)s and set notation is important
Two events are [Mutually Exclusive(Disjoint|[Disjoint)](Mutually%20Exclusive(Disjoint)]]) if they have no outcomes in common

[De Morgan's Laws](../Notes/De%20Morgan's%20Laws.md) states that $(A\cup B)^{c}=A^{c}\cap B^{c}$ and $(A\cap B)^{c}=A^{c}\cup B^{c}$ 

R sample replicates experiment

Properties of probabilities
1. If A implies B ($A \subseteq B$), then P(A) $\leq$ P(B) 
2. $P(A^{c}) = 1-P(A)$
3. $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$ 

[Permutation](../Notes/Permutation.md) is number of ways you can arrange n objects in row
[Combination](../Notes/Combination.md) is number of ways to select r objects from n objects

The [Probability Function](../Notes/Probability%20Function.md) P is a function that defines the probability for an event in the sample space
## Week 2
**Textbook Chapter 3**
_From section 3.6 Exercises: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.11 and 3.16_

### Notes
The [Conditional Probability](../Notes/Conditional%20Probability.md) A given B is the probability that A will happen if B happens
The [Multiplication Rule](../Notes/Multiplication%20Rule.md) is derivation a rearranging of the formula for conditional 
An event A is [Independent](../Notes/Independence.md) of B if $P(A|B) = P(A)$
Independent is different from mutually exclusive, independent events can happen at the same times, but have the same chance of occurring regardless

The [Law of total probability](../Notes/Law%20of%20total%20probability.md) gives a way of calculating the probability of an event given its conditional probability with disjoint events

[Bayes Rule](../Notes/Bayes%20Rule.md) calculates the conditional probability of an event given the conditional probability of it with another event

A [Discrete Random Variable](../Notes/Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md) is the **numerical** outcomes of a random experiment (*quantitative random outcome*)

The [Probability Distribution](../../STA238/STA238%20Notes/Probability%20Distribution.md) of a random variable tells us what values the function can take on, and how to assign probabilities to those values
	[Binomial Distribution](../Notes/Binomial%20Distribution.md) gives values for experiments with two possible outcomes
	[Bernoulli distribution](../Notes/Bernoulli%20distribution.md) is the binomial distribution with only one trial

The [Probability Mass Function](../Notes/Probability%20Mass%20Function.md) gives probability values to values of [Discrete Random Variable](../Notes/Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md)s

The [Cumulative Distribution Function](../Notes/Cumulative%20Distribution%20Function.md) gives the probability of a experiment giving the value of a [Discrete Random Variable](../Notes/Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md) or lower

The [Expected Value](../Notes/Expected%20Value.md) or expectation of a discrete random variable is the **mean** of all its probabilities

The [Variance](../Notes/Variance.md) of a discrete random variable is how much it varies from the expected value

The [Standard Deviation](../Notes/Standard%20Deviation.md) of a [Discrete Random Variable](../Notes/Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md) is the positive square root of its [Variance](../Notes/Variance.md)

The [Moment Generating Function](../Notes/Moment%20Generating%20Function.md) can be used to more easily calculate moments of the expected value

Some experiments take values on a **continuous scale**, for example probability that a bride collapses with different load weights

A [random variable](../Notes/Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md) is **continuous** if the probability that an event occurs between two points is the [Integral](../../MAT235/Notes/Integral.md) of the [Probability Mass Function](../Notes/Probability%20Mass%20Function.md) between those two points (or the area under the curve between the two points)

[Continuous Random Variable](../Notes/Continuous%20Random%20Variable.md)s are like [Discrete Random Variable](../Notes/Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md)s but describe such events that take values on a **continuous scale**, as opposed to [Discrete Random Variable](../Notes/Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md)s

The [Probability Distribution Function](../Notes/Probability%20Mass%20Function.md) for a [Continuous Random Variable](../Notes/Continuous%20Random%20Variable.md) is 0 at a single point, but has a value 

A [Continuous Random Variable](../Notes/Continuous%20Random%20Variable.md) has a [Continuous Uniform Distribution](../Notes/Continuous%20Uniform%20Distribution.md) if it has the same probability for occurring at every value

A [Normal Distribution](../Notes/Normal%20Distribution.md) is the most common distribution for a [Continuous Random Variable](../Notes/Continuous%20Random%20Variable.md). and can be calculated given the [Expected Value](../Notes/Expected%20Value.md), and the [Standard Deviation](../Notes/Standard%20Deviation.md)

An [Exponential Distribution](../Notes/Exponential%20Distribution.md) is similar to a [Geometric Distribution](../Notes/Geometric%20Distribution.md) but for [Continuous Random Variable](../Notes/Continuous%20Random%20Variable.md)s

The [Pareto Distribution](../Notes/Pareto%20Distribution.md) is similar in graph to the [Exponential Distribution](../Notes/Exponential%20Distribution.md), and simulates some situations better.

A [Quantile(Percentile|[Percentile)](Quantile(Percentile)]].md) describes what percentage of a population is lower or higher than a value of a **Continuous Random Variable**

A [Gamma Distribution](../Notes/Gamma%20Distribution.md) can be used to model the time until the $\alpha$th occurence of an event
