A **Utility [Function](../../Mathematics/MAT235%20Notes/Function.md)** describes mathematically the relationship between what [consumers](consumers) consume, and their level of happiness/well-being/[Utility](Utility.md)

---
# Notation
The utility someone enjoys from consuming combinations of two goods J and K can be written as:  
$$U=U(J,K)$$

> An example of a specific utility function for this consumer could be $$U=J\times K$$Here, the consumers level of utility is the product of the number of J and K



[Utility Optimization](Utility%20Optimization.md) can be done to determine the most optimal amount of goods a consumer should purchase
# Marginal Utility
[Marginal Utility](Marginal%20Utility.md) is the *extra* utility a consumer receives from a 1-unit increase in consumption.

The  of a consumer which enjoys two goods is $$MU_J=\frac{\Delta U(J,K)}{\Delta{J}}$$Or, the [Derivative](../../Mathematics/MAT235%20Notes/Derivative.md) of the **utility function** at a point
