The span of a set of [Vector](Vector.md)s V is the set of all linear combinations of vectors in V
$$span \ V \ = {\vec{v}:\vec{v} = a_1\vec{v}_{1+}\ ... \ +a_n\vec{v}_{n)}}  \ \forall \ \vec{v}_{1},\vec{v}_{2,}\ ... \ , \vec{v}_{n} \in V \ \& \ \forall \ a_{1},a_{2}, \ ... \ , a_{n}$$
Additionally
$$span\{\} = \{ \vec{0}\}$$

Span can also be used as a verb, for example, you can say that the set 
*{(1,1),(1,-2)} spans* $\mathbb{R} ^2$

Any and only Line or Planes which cross through the origin can be expressed as spans
