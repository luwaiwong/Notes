 **Returns to Scale** describes a *change in the amount of output in response to a  proportional increase in all the inputs* for a [Production Function](Production%20Function.md)

---

# Types
A **production function** has a **Constant Return to Scale** if *changing the amount of capital and labour by some multiple changes the quantity of the output by exactly the same multiple*

**Increasing Return to Scale** occurs if changing all inputs by the same proportion changes output *more than proportionally*

**Decreasing Return to Scale** occurs if changing all inputs by the same multiple changes output *less than that multiple*

# Factors
If a firm can replicate a production process, *output should grow proportionally with inputs* (**Constant Return to Scale**)

[Fixed Cost](Fixed%20Cost.md) and Economies of Scale can push output towards **Increasing Returns of Scale**
