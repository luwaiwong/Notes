The **Substitution effect** is the *change in a consumer's consumption choices resulting from a change in the relative prices between good*. Or, the effect of consumer wanting to buy more of a good that has become *relatively* cheaper

# Isolating the Substitution Effect
The Substitution effect is the change in quantity due to the change in relative prices

To calculate **substitution effect**, we must *isolate the substitution effect*

This can be done by finding the combination of goods that give how much of the goods a consumer would purchase with the new relative prices, but if they had the same **purchasing power**
## What does this mean
Graphically, this means with the same utility level and utility function as with the original price, how much would consumer purchase with the new [Budget Constraint](Budget%20Constraint.md) graph

# Types of Goods
## Substitutes
When two goods are [Substitutes](Substitutes.md),when the price of one good goes down, the quantity purchased goes down and the quantity of the other good purchased goes up

## Complements
When two goods are [Complements](Complements.md), when the price of one good goes up or goes down, and the quantity purchased changes as well, the other good follows the trend

# Graph
The size of the substitution effect depends on the degree of curvature between the [Indifference Curve](Indifference%20Curve.md)s

This is because [Indifference Curve](Indifference%20Curve.md)s have more curvature when two goods are not highly substitutable. Goods would obviously have smaller substitution effects the worse substitutes they are for each other.
