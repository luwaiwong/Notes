A **Relation** between two [Set](Set.md)s is an *association* or [Relationship](Relationship.md) between the elements of the two sets

A **Relation** itself is a set, which contains all the [Relationships](Relationship.md) between the elements of the two sets

# Definition
Formally, the relation of two sets $A$ and $B$ is a [Subset](Subset) of the product $A\times B$, $R\subset A\times B$

> If two sets have a relation, then that means their elements have an association/[Relationship](Relationship.md) with one another in some way  
> The product $A\times B$ would result in a set where every element of $A$, would be with every element of $B$.  
> 	This gives us every possible combination of one element from $A$ and one element of $B$  
> 	The relation would be a subset of this set $A\times B$, and tell us which elements from $A$ have an association with which elements from $B$

>Example of a simple relation  
> If we define $A=B$ as the set of integers, and the relation *Less Than* between $A$ and $B$ as the set of ordered pairs of integers $(a,b)$ such that $a<b$.  
> 	The ordered pair $(-2,7)$ belongs to *Less Than*, but $(2,2)$ or $(5,3)$ do not belong
## Properties
- Relations can be defined with any number of sets
- The number of sets involved in a relation is called the [Arity](Arity.md) of the relation
