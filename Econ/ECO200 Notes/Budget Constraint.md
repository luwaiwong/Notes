The **Budget Constraint** is a curve that describes all the [Consumption Bundle](Consumption%20Bundle.md)s a consumer can purchase by spending all income. 

---
# Formal Definition
For a straight budget constraint with no quantity discounts, the **budget constraint** can be described as: $$Income=P_XQ_X+P_YQ_Y$$$P_X$ and $P_Y$ are the prices for 1 unit of goods X and Y
$Q_X$ and $Q_Y$ are the quantities of the two goods

> The relative prices between the two goods determines the **slope** of the budget constraint.

Say Sarah wants to purchase burritos and lattes. Sarah has an income of $50 to spend on burritos ($10 each) and lattes ($5 each). The budget constraint for Sarah's purchase could be: ![Pasted image 20231011000329](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231011000329.png)

# Feasible Bundles
Combination of goods on or below the budget constraint is a **feasible bundle**. Anything else is an **infeasible bundle**

# Quantity Discounts
Often, when you buy more of something, you get a discount. The **Quantity Discounts** can affect the budget constraint graph

**Quantity Limits** are also sometimes imposed on products
