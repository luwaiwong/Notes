An **Indifference Curve** represents the combination of all the different bundles of goods that the consumer is [Indifferent](Indifferent.md) towards, or gives a consumer the same amount of [Utility](Utility.md). **Indifference Curves** are similar to [Contour Diagram](../../Math/MAT235%20Notes/Contour%20Diagram.md)s

# Definition
The Indifference curve is defined as the combination of all different bundles of goods which the consumer has the same amount of Utility

Thus, given a [Utility Function](Utility%20Function.md) $U=U(J,K)$, the indifference curve can be found by holding $U$ constant.


> [!Example]  
Say someone is looking to rent an apartment, and they like living around friends. Their [Utility Function](Utility%20Function.md) can be defined by: $$U=U(\text{Num of Friends}, \text{Apt Size})$$An example of the indifference curve could be:![Pasted image 20231010233718](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231010233718.png)

# Properties
- Every value of [Utility](Utility.md) has a different **indifference curve**
- Any **indifferent curve** that is closer to the origin (zero units of both goods) than another curve, has a lower [Utility](Utility.md)
- You can *always* draw indifference curves. All bundles have a utility level, and we can rank them
- We can figure out which **indifference curves** have higher **utility** levels and why they slop downwards. ("More is better" assumption)
- **Indifference curves** never cross 
- **Indifference curves** are *convex* to the origin(bend towards the origin in the middle and away at the edges)
- The more curved the **indifference curve**, the less [substitutable](Substitutes.md) (or more [complementary](Complements.md)) are the goods

The **slope** of the indifference curve represents the [Marginal Rate of Substitution](Marginal%20Rate%20of%20Substitution.md)
