## Bases
The **Dimension** of a [Subspace](Subspace.md) $V$ is the number of elements in a basis for V.

Since [Base](Base.md)s are the most simple form for a [Subspace](Subspace.md), and all **bases** for a **subspace** have the same number of elements ([](Base.md#^7d8441)), The **Dimension** describes this number of elements
