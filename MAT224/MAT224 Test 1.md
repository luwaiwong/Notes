# Overview
need to know
	def of a subspace

A [Vector Space](MAT224%20Notes/Vector%20Space.md) is a [Set](../MAT223/Set.md) $V$, whose elements are called [Vectors](../MAT223/Vector.md)
	Items in the vector space can be added together, and multiplied by [Scalars](../MAT223/Scalar.md)
	Items in the vector space much satisfy a set of *axioms*
	A set that follows the axioms is a [Vector Space](MAT224%20Notes/Vector%20Space.md), otherwise it is not

A [Subspace](../MAT223/Subspace.md) is a [Subset](Subset) of a [Vector Space](MAT224%20Notes/Vector%20Space.md),
