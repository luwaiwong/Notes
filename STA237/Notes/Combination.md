The **Combination** of a [Set](../../MAT223/Set.md) is any subset of $r$ unordered elements from a set of $n$ distinct elements

Can be thought of as the *number of ways to select $r$ objects from $n$ objects*, and can be called *"n Choose r"*

The number of ways to select $r$ objects from $n$ objects is $$_nC_{r}=\begin{pmatrix} n \\ r\end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$
