# Given Individual Demand Curves
Given the [Demand Curve](Demand%20Curve.md)s of multiple individuals, the **Market Demand** is the sum horizontally of all the individual demand curves

## Algebraically
Given two demand curves, such as $$Q_{1}=5-0.05P \ \text{ and } \ Q_{2}=13-0.25P$$
The **market demand** is the *sum of the individual demand curves*
For example: $$\begin{aligned} Q_{market} &=Q_{1}+Q_{2} \\ Q_{market}&= (5-0.05P)+(13-0.25P) \\ Q_{market}&=18-0.3P\end{aligned}$$
## Properties of Individual Demand Curves
- A market demand curve will never be to the left of any individual demand curve.
- With limited individuals in a market, if an individual has a higher demand than others in th market, it may be the only individual in the market purchasing goods in the market.
> 	From the example given above, Consumer 1 has a maximum price of $100, and Consumer 2 has a maximum price of $52.
> 	This means, for a price above $52, the market demand consists only Consumer 1's demand
