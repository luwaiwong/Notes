## Task 1
Choose one problem from a worked example in the textbook OR a worked example from one of the "[MAT223 More practice with solutions Problems](MAT223%20More%20practice%20with%20solutions%20Problems.md)" sections on the [Supplemental Handouts](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/316280/pages/practice-handouts-and-solutions-and-more "Practice Handouts and Solutions (and more!)") that you find interesting.  Choose a handout from a module we have covered in the lecture only.

**Guideline**: You should write 250 or more words for this task. 

1. State the problem.
2. Describe why you find the problem/example mathematically interesting and what you learned from the problem/example.  
3. Connect the ideas in your chosen problem/example to other ideas in MAT223.

### Brainstorming
Topic
- Dot product?
	- q6
- [ Cartesian Vector and Normal Forms Handout](4%20mat223_cartesian__vector__normal_forms.pdf)]
- backup do row reducing
### Answer
I found some the questions in the Norm and Dot Product handout from the practice with solutions section interesting, specifically questions like question 5 and 6. Question 6 states
$QUESTION$

## Task 2
Select one problem or concept you have worked on so far in MAT223 that you did not understand right away or struggled with.  You can choose a practice problem from the textbook, a MathMatize problem, a core exercise, or a problem worked on in the lecture.  Recall in Reading Assignment 2 the ideas about growth mindsets (Dr. Carol Dweck, John Legend). 

**Guideline**: You should write 250 or more words for this task. 

1. State the problem/concept.
2. Explain what you were stuck on or struggling to understand.
3. Explain what you gained from the process of being stuck. (Some people call this fruitful struggle or productive failure.)

matrix row reduced echelon form

### Answer
---
One problem I worked on in MAT223 which I initially struggled with near the beginning of the course was Reduced Row Echelon Form. The Row Reduced Echelon form of a matrix has
- The first non-zero entry in every row being a one
- Every one of the leading one has zeros above and below it
- The leading ones forming a staircase pattern in the matrix
- And if there is a row of zero, it appears at the bottom of X
A matrix in row reduced echelon form would look something like this 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & | &-1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & | & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0\end{bmatrix}$$

In the beginning, I really struggled to understand how to achieve the reduce row echelon form from a given matrix, and I was confused as to how the row echelon form of a matrix would retain its original information. In the end, I realized that the reason I struggled understanding these concepts was because of a lack of understanding from the previous appendix section. I didn't properly understand matrices, and more importantly didn't properly understand the process of row reduction.

Getting stuck helped me to realize my lack of understanding in the subject, and led me to realize that I had to take a step back, and review everything else I had learned before I could tackle the topic. Going back and reviewing with the purpose of solving that problem helped to give me a better understanding of the topic
