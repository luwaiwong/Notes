The **Income Effect** is the change in a [Consumer](Consumer)'s consumption choices that results from a change in the purchasing power of the consumer's income.

# Price Changes
When the *relative prices between two goods* change, the **Income Effect** is the change in quantity consumed due to an **increase in purchasing power**

To find the **income effect** after a change in relative prices, it is easiest to first find the [Substitution Effect](Substitution%20Effect.md), and find the difference between it, and the **Total Effect**

# Calculation
Mathematically, the **income effect** is $$\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta I}$$Or the **first ratio in** [Income Elasticity](Income%20Elasticity.md)  
Increasing income allows consumers to purchase bundles of goods that allow higher [Utility](Utility.md) levels

# Types of Goods
A good for which **consumption rises when income rises** is a [Normal Good](Normal%20Good.md)
- Normal goods have different *classes*
	- Normal goods with an [Income Elasticity](Income%20Elasticity.md) between 0 and 1 are called [Necessity Goods](Necessity%20Goods.md), and rise with income, but at a slower rate.
	- Normal goods with an [Income Elasticity](Income%20Elasticity.md) greater than 1 are called [Luxury Goods](Luxury%20Goods.md)  
A good for which **consumption decreases when income rises** is an [Inferior Good](Inferior%20Good.md)

An example of the [|utility graph](Utility%20Function.md) of a consumer changing their[ utility-maximizing ](Utility%20Optimization.md)bundle when one good is an [Inferior Good](Inferior%20Good.md)

The effect of an income change on a good's consumption being positive (*consumption increases*) or negative (*consumption decreases*) can **vary with the level of income**

Examples
- Used 
	- Likely to be normal good at low levels of income
	- Inferior good at high levels of income
